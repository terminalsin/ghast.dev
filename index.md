# About me

Hi, I'm Shanyu Thibaut, a BS student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I study Computer Science.

## Interests

- **Compilers:** disassembly, (de)optimization, decompilers
- **Obfuscation:** dynamic opaque predicates, SSA and virtualization
- **Law**: civil and ip law

## Projects

I'm responsible for the following projects
- [**Skidfuscator Java Obfuscator**](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/skidfuscator-java-obfuscator): Full Java obfuscator with inter-procedural obfuscation, leveraging SSA form to create some of the most complex flow obfuscation found in java
- [**Artemis Anticheat**](https://github.com/artemisac/artemis-minecraft-anticheat): Java anticheating software toolset designed to emulate and replicate Minecraft's physics engine on the server-side based on incomplete data and heuristically bruteforced inferences. Currently the project spans over 100,000 lines of code
- [**Various Packet/Protocol APIs**](https://github.com/terminalsin/fairy-packet-starter): Designed various packet apis for various different projects
- Multiplayer mods for Cities Skylines
- Reversal of various Android applications, including the SSL unpinning and source-code reversal of Snapchat, Tinder, Instagram, etc..
- Responsible for the discovery of an CVSS 9.4 RCE in [Aioz Network](https://aioz.network/), impacting over 50,000 end users. 
- Responsible for the discovery of various other bugs in Phala Network, other blockchains, etc

## Research
- [Taking Java Obfuscation to the Next Level by Exploiting SSA Form](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/skidfuscator-java-obfuscator) (2024, CCSC-NE Finalist)
- Analysis, evaluation and proposal of an inter-procedural Java Obfuscation methodology (2023, publishing soon?)
- [Java String Encryption Performance Enhancement with JDK11+](https://github.com/skidfuscatordev/constant-dynamic-research/) (2024, IEEE plz plz plz accept)
